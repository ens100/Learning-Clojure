Hi, I am Ed. In my day to day life I work as an accountant and in order to add a little spice I thought it would be a good idea to learn Clojure in my spare time. I am interested in Machine Learning and Big Data as well as being a little bit addicted to the various PKM apps out there. Want to learn Clojure as an introduction to the programming world.

I made a bit start in early July 2020 learning of the background to Clojure and getting it set up:

# ClojureFam

To up the ante a little more, I have decided to take part in what I think is a fantastic intitative called ["ClojureFam"](https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam) which has the purpose "To spread joy and create wealth by increasing the number of Clojure developers and strengthening relationships within the global Clojure community". Looks great and very thankful I have this opportunity and to the people who set it up [Jeff Tang](https://github.com/tangjeff0) and [nthd3gr33](https://github.com/nthd3gr33), amongst the many others

## What Does it  Involve?
- Spending the next 5 weeks learning about Clojure on a daily basis.
- Being  part of a Cohort so that we can all learn together and discuss issues / problems
- Keep myself accountable and motivated. It is so easy to skip a day and then lose track
- Learn and be efficient in a new language.

That being said, in the below I will include a daily post of what I learnt and what I did to learn it and for the next 5 weeks (and many many more weeks after that) I will be learning Clojure from the various means available. 

It will be a tough journey I am sure, but hopefully will have some fun along the way. Just learning about GitHub has been fun so far

## LearnInPublic

I am using this repository as as a public record to track my progress and will be posting every day / every couple of days.
