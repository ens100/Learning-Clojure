## [Chapter 3](https://aphyr.com/posts/303-clojure-from-the-ground-up-functions)
### Funcitions
#### Let
##### Define a meaning for a symbol within a specific expression, using `let`.
##### (let [cats 5] (str "I have " cats " cats.")) - this will replace the first cats with 5
##### (let [+ -] (+ 2 3)) - the + will be replaced with - as it is saying let + be -
##### (let [person  "joseph" num-cats 186] (str person " has " num-cats " cats!")) - this is a multiple bindings
##### (let [cats 3 legs (* 4 cats)]  (str legs " legs all together")) - in this case it takes the first criteria and applies it and so on
#### Functions
##### Almost all verbs in Clojure are funcitons
##### Functions represent unrealized computation: expressions which are not yet evaluated, or incomplete
##### shorthand for writing functions `#(+ % 1)` is equivalent to `(fn [x] (+ x 1))`
#### Vars
##### Redefine symbols for everyone–even code that we didn’t write–we need a new construct: a mutable variable
##### (def astronauts []) / (def astronauts ["Sally Ride" "Guy Bluford"])
##### Redefining names in this way changes the meaning of expressions everywhere in a program, without warning
#### Defining functions
##### (def half (fn [number] (/ number 2)))
##### (defn half [number] (/ number 2)) - above is shortened
##### (defn half ([]  1/2) ([x] (/ x 2))) - when calling multiple items
### Cool features of Clojure
#### (fn? type) - Is it a function?
#### (doc type / type / name) - What does the documentation say?
#### (meta #'type) - What about type's meta data?
#### (source type) - What about the actual source code?
