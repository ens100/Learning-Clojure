Today I was hoping to get started and complete building a basic todo app but as I got started on the video which presented the exercises I realised that there were many unknowns to me. 

There were things such as PostgreSQL, having to tweak the localhost, connecting it up to GIT that I thought I am going into an area I am not comfortable with yet as would prefer to focus on grasping the basics of Clojure before moving onto more advanced topics. 

I followed the video to the end and updated my code for each step but I was unable to get it posted online. Oh well, at least I was still able to put some time to learning Clojure today. 

Tomorrow I think I will get back to basics and build a bakery with the assistance of a couple of videos. Hopefully this will cement my basic learning of Clojure and allow me to move forward.
