Today read through Chapters 1 and 2 of "Clojure from the ground Up".

## Chapter 1
### Values (Nouns)
#### Nil - most basic value
#### Ture / false - bolleans
#### 0, 1, -47, 1/3 - numbers
#### "Hello World" - String
### Verbs
#### "inc" (increment) - points to a values
#### Reference to other values
#### Clojure evaluates a symbol
### Sentences
#### Add ' (eg. '"foo") and get back what you wrote (the expression or sentence)
#### Returns the text unchanged
### List
#### Lists can contain anything: Numbers, Strings, other lists
#### List order is innermost to outermost
#### Think of these as trees
## Chapter 2
### Basic Types
#### Integers
##### Long/MAX_VALUE
##### BigInt (for really big numbers)
##### Short/MAX_VALUE
##### byte/MAX_VALUE
#### Fractional Numbers
##### Floats us 32 buts and Doubles use 64 - Doubles are default
##### Ratio (eg. 1/3) exact value
#### Mathematical Operatoins
##### (+ 1  2) = 3 sames goes for (+ 1  2.0) 
##### = "are all things that follow hte same?
##### ==  "are the things the same but more loosely
##### Similar things can be used (* / - / )
##### (<= 1 2 3) = true - numbers are in order
##### inc (increment) and dec (decrease?) will add or subtract 1 respectively
#### Strings
##### Can make almost anything into a string (symbols, booleans, numbers)
##### (str "cat") = (str 'cat)
##### Can concatenate (str "meow " 3 " times") = meow 3 times
##### re-find look for occurrences in a string
###### (re-find #"cat" "mystic cat mouse") = "cat"
###### (re-find #"cat" "mystic cat mouse") = nil
##### re-matches 
#### Booleans and Logic
##### false and nil are negative, all else true
##### (and ) = (and 1 2 3)
##### (or ) = (or false 2 3)
##### (not ) = (not nil)
#### Symbols
##### bare strings of characters like foo or +
##### Symbols is to refer to things, to point to other values
#### Keywords
##### :cat = keyword
##### these are specifically intended for use as labels or identifiers
##### Keywords are most useful when paired with other values in a collection, like a map
#### Lists
##### Collection is a group of values Containers provide structure Elements or Members are inside of collections list is a type of collection
##### We single quote to prevent lists being evaluated ’(1 2 3)
##### (list 1 2 3)
##### Conjoin lists (conj ’(1 2 3) 4) => (4 1 2 3)
##### (first ’(1 2 3)), (second ’(1 2 3)), (nth ’(1 2 3), 2)
##### Zero indexed
##### Well suited for small collection or things that are read in linear order.
##### Slow if you want to get arbitrary elements from later.
#### Vectors
##### Square brackets.
##### [1 2 3] Don’t need to be quoted as they are evaluated differently from lists.
##### (vector 1 2 3) returns [1 2 3]
##### (vec (list 1 2 3)) returns [1 2 3]
##### (conj [1 2 3] 4) returns [1 2 3 4]
#####
##### first, second and nth work but nth is fast for vectors
##### (rest …) and (next …) returns everything but the first
##### rest returns () when done and next returns nil(count [1 2 3])
##### (= ’(1 2 3) [1 2 3]) if they contain the same elements in the same order they are considered equal.
#### Sets
##### Unordered collection of value - good for if you plan to ask questions like “does the collection have the number 3 in it?”
##### #{:a :b :c} => will not always be in the same order.
##### (sort #{:a :b :c}) will return them in order
##### (conj #{:a :b :c} :d)
##### Conjoining will only contain each element once and will discard repeats.
##### (disj #{“cow” “sheep”} #{“sheep”}) will return cow as this is the disjoin of the sets.
##### (contains? #{1 2 3} 3) returns true
##### Make any collection a set with the keyword (set (1 2 3))
#### Maps
##### Key/Value pairs
##### Surrounded by curly braces {…} and filled with alternating keys and values.
##### (get {“cat” “meow” “dog” “woof”} “cat”) will return “meow”
##### (get {:a 1 :b 2} :c) - will return false
##### (get {:glinda :good} :wicked :not-here) can provide a default value as the 4th argument.
##### (assoc {:bolts 1088} :camshafts 3) add to a map with assoc
##### (assoc {:camshafts 3} :camshafts 2) if they key already exists the value will be overwritten.
##### (merge {:a 1 :b 2} {:b 3 :c 4}) - this combines maps and will prefer values from the later maps.
##### (dissoc {:potatoes 5 :mushrooms 2} :mushrooms) will remove a key/value pair.
