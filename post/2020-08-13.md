Today I went through Day 1 of the Bakery training provided on Purely Functional. It was so good to be able to follow step by step what was going on and what was happening. I am glad I started off reading but also very happy that i then moved onto something a bit more practical as i find it a little easier to follow
 
 Learnt of defn and calling functions and basically how Clojure interacts. Everything was done in the REPL and tomorrow will be using  a file.
