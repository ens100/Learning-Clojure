Today was a day on refractoring, refractoring, refractoring.

How to get a hugh block of code into something a lot simpler.

From:
```clojure
(defn fetch-list [shopping-list]
  (go-to :pantry)
  (when (contains? shopping-list :flour)
    (load-up-amount :flour (get shopping-list :flour)))
  (when (contains? shopping-list :sugar)
    (load-up-amount :sugar (get shopping-list :sugar)))

  (go-to :fridge)
  (when (contains? shopping-list :egg)
    (load-up-amount :egg (get shopping-list :egg)))
  (when (contains? shopping-list :milk)
    (load-up-amount :milk (get shopping-list :milk)))
  (when (contains? shopping-list :butter)
    (load-up-amount :butter (get shopping-list :butter)))

  (go-to :prep-area)
  (when (contains? shopping-list :flour)
    (unload-amount :flour (get shopping-list :flour)))
  (when (contains? shopping-list :sugar)
    (unload-amount :sugar (get shopping-list :sugar)))
  (when (contains? shopping-list :egg)
    (unload-amount :egg (get shopping-list :egg)))
  (when (contains? shopping-list :milk)
    (unload-amount :milk (get shopping-list :milk)))
  (when (contains? shopping-list :butter)
    (unload-amount :butter (get shopping-list :butter))))
```

To:

```clojure
(defn fetch-list [shopping-list]
  (go-to :pantry)
  (load-up-amount :flour (get shopping-list :flour 0))
  (load-up-amount :sugar (get shopping-list :sugar 0))

  (go-to :fridge)
  (load-up-amount :egg (get shopping-list :egg 0))
  (load-up-amount :milk (get shopping-list :milk 0))
  (load-up-amount :butter (get shopping-list :butter 0))

  (go-to :prep-area)
  (unload-amount :flour (get shopping-list :flour 0))
  (unload-amount :sugar (get shopping-list :sugar 0))
  (unload-amount :egg (get shopping-list :egg 0))
  (unload-amount :milk (get shopping-list :milk 0))
  (unload-amount :butter (get shopping-list :butter 0)))
```
