The last few days at work have been intense so I have not been able to dedicate too much time to my Clojure learning, but thankfully it is the weekend so that I can hopefully spend some time on this. 

Managed  to find a cool video which gives a good introduction of Clojure and how to get it set up in Intellij and run different things. I can now follow the various different steps and the purpose of REPL and how to make it run so that can evaluate the script. 

Today managed to:
- Follow the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLsddw8_bt4&t=673s) + (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8wgMG5AZIE&t=338s)
- Work out the shortcut for the REPL (Alt + Shift + P)
- Work through the various different Types and get an understanding of what each of them does
- Test the mangle and demangle functions 
- Understand that you can do ```Def``` followed by ```fn``` or use the shortcut ```Defn```

Feel quite content with my progress.
