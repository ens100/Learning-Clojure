So, today was a day that I spent collecting my thoughts and trying to find various different sources of beginner Clojure information so that I could get my head around:
- What it is
- How it works
- What it can achieve
- How best to get started

What I like to do is to have an end vision in sight so that I have something to work towards, so that I can have a path and a point of where I want to go. I find that If I do not have this then I will spin my wheels for a long time and then lose focus and drive. 

So that being said, here are the few interesting links and readings that I found:
- (https://aphyr.com/tags/Clojure-from-the-ground-up)
- (https://www.braveclojure.com/introduction/)
- (http://www.clojurenewbieguide.com/)
- (http://kimh.github.io/clojure-by-example/)
- (http://clojure-doc.org/)
- (https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/clojure/)

What I set out to achieve was to get an overall sense (or at least a grounding) of Clojure and what it can do. I think I was able to read up on this and satisfy my mind and curiosity.
