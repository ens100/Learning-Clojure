Today was a day I spent readingin through some code. I worked on a few theoretical projects and was now looking through code to make sure I understood everything as it should be and thayt it makes sense to me. 

I also was able to complete a few more problems on 4Clojure and just about at the 40 problems solved mark. Hopefully to get to 40 will not be too much longer.

Started reading some more of CLojure for the Brave and True to advance my learning and will try to do a few more practical projects to  make the learning stick
