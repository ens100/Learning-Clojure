# 4Clojure

## 1. Nothing but the Truth

```clojure
true - although `(not false)` also seems to work, interesting.
```

## 2. Simple Math

```clojure
4
```

## 3. Intro to Strings

```clojure
"HELLO WORLD"
```

## 4. Intro to Lists

```clojure
:a :b :c - man these brackets and semi columns will take some getting used to
```

## 5. Lists: conj

```clojure
'(1 2 3 4) - hmm interesting, conj takes the last item and adds it to the fron of the list.
```

## 6. Intro to Vectors

```clojure
:a :b :c - similar to the lists point, intersting, vectors and lists - need to research further what is exact difference
```

## 7. Vectors: conj

```clojure
'(1 2 3 4)
```

## 8. Intro to Sets

```clojure
#{:a :b :c :d}
```

## 9. Sets: conj

```clojure
2 - adds a character
```

## 10. Intro to Maps

```clojure
20 - returns the value of b
```

## 11.  Maps: conj

```clojure
[:b 2] - interestingly {:b 2} also works
```
